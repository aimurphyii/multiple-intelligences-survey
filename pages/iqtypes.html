    <h2>7 Intelligence Types</h2>
    <p>Howard Gardener originally named seven areas of intelligence. Two additional areas have since been added - Nauturalist and Existentialist. However this quiz assesses the original seven. Most schools primarily focus on linguistic and logical-mathematical, however all of these areas take skill and are needed for important and fullfilling careers.</p>

      <h3>Linguistic intelligence</h3>
      <p>Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to
          learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This
          intelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself rhetorically
          or poetically; and language as a means to remember information. Writers, poets, lawyers
          and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic
          intelligence.

      <h3>Logical-mathematical intelligence</h3>
      <p>Logical-mathematical intelligence consists of the capacity to analyze problems
          logically, carry out mathematical operations, and investigate issues scientifically. In
          Howard Gardner's words, it entails the ability to detect patterns, reason deductively and
          think logically. This intelligence is most often associated with scientific and mathematical thinking.
