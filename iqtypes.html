    <h2>7 Intelligence Types</h2>
    <p>Howard Gardener originally named seven areas of intelligence. Two additional areas have since been added -
      Naturalist and Existentialist. However this quiz assesses the original seven. Most schools primarily focus on linguistic and logical-mathematical, however all of these areas take skill and are needed for important and fullfilling careers.</p>

Writers, poets, lawyers and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic intelligence.</p>
