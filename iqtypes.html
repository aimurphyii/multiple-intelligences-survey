    <h2>7 Intelligence Types</h2>
    <p>Howard Gardener originally named seven areas of intelligence. Two additional areas have since been added -
      Nauturalist and Existentialist. However this quiz assesses the original seven. Most schools primarily focus on linguistic and logical-mathematical, however all of these areas take skill and are needed for important and fullfilling careers.</p>

      <p>Linguistic intelligence involves sensitivity to spoken and written language, the ability to learn languages, and the capacity to use language to accomplish certain goals. This intelligence includes the ability to effectively use language to express oneself rhetorically or poetically; and language as a means to remember information. Writers, poets, lawyers and speakers are among those that Howard Gardner sees as having high linguistic intelligence.</p>
